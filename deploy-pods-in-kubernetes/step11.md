## Running Commands in Your Container with exec
Sometimes logs are insufficient, and to truly determine whatâ€™s going on you need to execute commands in the context of the container itself. To do this you can use:

`kubectl exec nginx date`{{execute}}

You can also get an interactive session by adding the -it flags:

`kubectl exec -it nginx --  bash`{{execute}}
